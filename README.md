## Statistical Findings of NYC Bikesharing Data:
- Males are more likely to utilize the bikesharing program
- The most popular times to start & stop rentals are during the morning and evening commutes to/from work.
- The popularity of the bikesharing service was more pronounced in the areas of corporate offices.



## Analysis Results of Checkout times on Bikesharing Data:
- Bikes were most often used for short duration trips.  The explanation for this is likely that the intended use was for commuting, or getting from 
  point A to point B, and less so for casual enjoyment.
- Checkout times by gender point to a more elevated use for the service by males.
